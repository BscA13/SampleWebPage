# SampleWebPage

Here's a simple example of a web page template that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This template includes a basic frontend layout and interacts with a Python backend using AJAX for dynamic data retrieval.

This template includes a frontend layout with a header and a content section. It has a button that, when clicked, triggers an AJAX request to the Python backend to retrieve data. The Python backend uses Flask to serve the web page and provide the data through a JSON endpoint.

Make sure to have Flask installed (pip install Flask) and run the Python script (app.py) to start the server. You can customize and expand upon this template to create more complex full-stack applications.
