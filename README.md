# SampleWebPage

Here's a simple example of a web page template that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This template includes a basic frontend layout and interacts with a Python backend using AJAX for dynamic data retrieval.

This template includes a frontend layout with a header and a content section. It has a button that, when clicked, triggers an AJAX request to the Python backend to retrieve data. The Python backend uses Flask to serve the web page and provide the data through a JSON endpoint.

Make sure to have Flask installed (pip install Flask) and run the Python script (app.py) to start the server. You can customize and expand upon this template to create more complex full-stack applications.

Dockerization:
Make sure to place this Dockerfile and requirements.txt file in the same directory as your project files.

To build the Docker image, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile, and run:

Copy code
docker build -t mywebapp .
This will build an image named mywebapp.

To run the container, use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 mywebapp
This maps port 5000 from the container to port 5000 on your host machine. You should be able to access the web application by going to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Remember to adjust the filenames and paths in the Dockerfile if your project structure is different. Additionally, consider adding more configuration and security settings as needed for production environments.
